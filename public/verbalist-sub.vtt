verbalist is a vs code extension that enables 
users to edit documents using natural language  

00:07.040 --> 00:14.000
uh hands free so this extension is powered 
by Groq's speech to text API that uses Open  

00:14.000 --> 00:23.520
AI's Whisper AI models and Groq's super fast 
hardware to convert speech to text and these  

00:23.520 --> 00:30.040
text commands are fed to Llama over Groq's 
Hardware to get the VS Code commands these VS  

00:30.040 --> 00:35.680
code commands are important because we bind them 
to keyboard bindings to edit the actual document  

00:35.680 --> 00:42.240
automatically so let me just demonstrate how 
we can use these AI models so let's just say  

00:42.240 --> 00:46.200
I want to delete the line 15 so I'm going to 
ask the model so I bounded the extension to  

00:46.200 --> 00:55.600
command shift Z so I'll ask it now so uh Delete 
line 15 so it's going to make an API request,  

00:55.600 --> 01:01.440
convert the speech to text and feed it to Llama 
and that's what it did and you can see the line  

01:01.440 --> 01:08.720
was deleted. I'm going to Cmd Shift Z to make sure 
we have the original document. For fun let's also  

01:08.720 --> 01:12.960
insert something so let's just say we want to 
insert hello let's just insert hello at the  

01:12.960 --> 01:21.560
current cursor, so I'm going to ask the extension 
again so command shift Z "insert hello" so it did  

01:21.560 --> 01:26.760
that and hello has been inserted so as you can 
see there are various use cases to edit document  

01:26.760 --> 01:34.840
just by the simple uh shortcut. Now for fun we're 
going to replace all the words with cookie so uh  

01:34.840 --> 01:42.480
let's just do it. Replace all words with cookies! 
We did that and as you can see, it's very fast.  

01:42.480 --> 01:48.440
It converts all the speech to text with Groq's 
super fast hardware and uses the APIs to send  

01:48.440 --> 01:55.960
request to Llama and get the VS Code bindings 
and edit the document instantly! Thank you
